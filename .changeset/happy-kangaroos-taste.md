Replace [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) with [`markdown-exit`](https://markdown-exit.pages.dev/guide/introduction.html).

You can now use async plugins as well as async syntax highlighers with `vite-plugin-svelte-md`, with complete compatibility with the `markdown-it` ecostystem! See [`markdown-exit` documentation](https://markdown-exit.pages.dev/guide/migrate-from-markdown-it.html#plugin-compatibility) for more details.
